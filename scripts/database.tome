WIKTOPHER
  BREF : Wiktopher begins with a fall, living on the back of a giant desert creature can be dangerous like that. Lupin has never left home, and wouldnt have if it hadnt been for that accident. Being alone in a new place is scary, but not if you have Eka with you to light the way. Together, they learn the innumerable ways of the world. They traverse deserts and villages, meeting their inhabitants and discovering their customs.
  LONG
    & Wiktopher is a fiction story published online, (of ~60,000 words) taking place in a fantasy world. The novel will have a number of added content that will permit the reader to learn more of the world and of its people.
    & I hope to make an audiobook version, and maybe a print version if there is enough interest.
    * Features
    - An illustrated glossary of plants
    - An illustrated glossary of animals
    - Recipes, made with plants of that world
    - A language alphabet, and songs
    - An illustrated world map
    - Written without gender pronouns

  BREF : Happiness? There is no such thing. All you can do is live.
  LONG
    & Circa is a work-in-progress, changes and chapters will be published regularly. Is it the story of many, focused on the contradictory lives of Sy and Token.
    & So it is here now, for you to read. Know that it can still change. Enjoy.

THOUSAND ROOMS
  BREF : Thousand Rooms is a visual novel collaboration with Devine Lu Linvega, following the behaviours of four characters and a room.
  LONG
    & We have written this book with the hopes of creating a sort of Borges for children, in which the reader follows a bat, a cat, an owl and a fox who try and make sense of this simple system. The book also encourages to try and understand the rules, and plan unsuggested avenues.
    & The book is available in 13 languages: English, Lietal, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Italian, Dutch, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish and Portuguese.
