    <p>Mr. Cross</p>
    <p>Harlow Cross was a modest and wonderful musician, the violin was an extension of herself; it gave her another tongue, a second, and almost, better way to communicate with others. Choosing one cord over another, permitted her to convey emotions with such precision, that at times, playing in crowds made her self-conscious. Maybe she revealing too much. Despite this fear, Harlow continued to strike the cords with her bow. At this time, she performed in the town's music hall, and it's there, that her playing caught the attention of Michael.</p>
    <p> Michael was a writer, he'd lived here all his life. He was a person of habits, always went to write in crowded areas, and sometimes, in music halls. "In quiet places, my mind wanders far, far away. The noises of the world keep me tethered to this reality" he would tell others. It is what he told Harlow, one evening, when she came to speak to him after a performance. She had seen him in the audience before, they had exchanged glances, many times. Harlow felt like he was able to understand her music, his brows would rise and fall while writing, perfectly attuned to the music.</p>
    <p>They began to speak regularly after that, exchanging stories over cups of strong coffee. They would go out together to poetry readings, for walks outdoors, all this, rarely in the company of others. Both didn't have space in their lives for anyone else at the moment, they had each other, and their passions. A big enough family, if you asked them!<p>
    <p>Intimacy was always difficult for Michael, Harlow understood this. He wrote short stories for local magazines, and on the side, was neck-deep into his own novel. This, Harlow could not ask about. It was the only topic she had reluctantly vowed not to ask about, after his repeated warnings. They now lived in a space together, and although the manuscript of the book was in plain sight on his night stand, she never glanced into it. Michael had a rocky childhood, when young, he had passed through many hands, none of which offered him any real affection. No one had thought young Michael how to interact with others.<p>
    <p>One day, during one of their weekend getaways to a cabin in the mountains, they had their first intimate moment. It was on this day, that Sy was conceived. The young Sy Cross was born later that year. Harlow was happy, her partner felt more cheerful. Together they had created something new, something unique. A new person now walked this earth, and he bared Michael's dark hair and Harlow's smile. This moment of bliss did not last, Michael's health deteriorated. He was constantly lost inside his own head, and complained often about there not being any music playing in the room even if there was. There was always music playing, always something producing noises in their dwelling. Harlow was concerned, the music was not enough to keep her partner close to her anymore.</p>

    <p>Michael's DEATH</p>

    <p>During this time, Harlow was very much into her career and did not always have time to see what was going on with Michael. He was growing increasingly distant, his eyes always had a bit of a haze, like he was somewhere else. Harlow's grandmother came around often to offer help, but the stories she would tell her daughter when she returned were worrisome. "He does not eat, he does not drink. He is not writing anymore either, i saw him scratching a piece of paper all day today. The pen had no ink in it." Harlow decided it best to pause her music, to best care for her partner. It was becoming dangerous, he would forget to feed Sy at times too. One day, Harlow awoke to find Michael had died during the night. No one knows what happened, doctors speculated that perhaps whatever was going on inside him was giving him so much stress that his mind just... shut down.</p>

    
    <p>TOKEN MALVADO</p>

    <p>Growing up Sy had very few friends, Harlow hoped that would change once he started school. She couldn't help but feel concerned sometimes, fearing that if he didn't socialize he would end up like Michael. But once Sy was old enough to be able to attend school, he made a friend. The two didn't speak much to each other but liked to play cards. Seeing the two playing together was interesting because of the absence of conversation. The child he had befriended was Token Malvado, a boy who lived only a few streets away and whom Harlow recognized to be the son of Luciano Malvado, ex-boxer extraordinaire. When the boys grew up, Token became more outspoken and talkative and became popular at school. He was kind to everyone and was a talented boxer. Sy's tongue remained boxed in behind his teeth, keeping to himself still. It was hard for him to share his only friend with everyone else. Token was a nice kid ,and would always find time to hang out with Sy even if no one else really understood why. Harlow thought Token was one of the best things that had happened to her son, he had someone to talk to and to play with.</p>

    <p>THE BOOK

  <p>In the meantime, Harlow was doing alright for herself. Even after losing Michael, she pursued a career as a contemporary violinist. After spending years playing around the globe, she settled for a spot in a local orchestra to better care for her son Sy. Sy had his share of tormenters, having a learning disability made him an easy target. Sy could not read or write well, as if he couldn't understand the language. His teachers thought he was slow, while the other kids just called him stupid.</p>

 <p>Sy wasn't doing so well at school, he repeated a lot of his grades and it took him a long time to learn how to read. Even when older, he still had trouble.</p>

 <p>"You are pretty stupid aren't you?" Mackenzie, a boy at school, asked him when he saw a drawing he'd made. "Your name is two letters and you can't even write that!"</p>

 <p>Sy said nothing, embarrassed by it.</p>

 <p>"Here let me give you a hand", the boy ripped the pen from Sy's hands and wrote R E T A R D in big bold letters over his drawing. "See that's how you spell Sy."</p>

 <p>Sy stared at the word, but couldn't make it out. Another kid walked over just then, took one look at the drawing and the writing atop of it and laughed. "That says retard!"</p>

 <p>Sy's face reddened, he tore up the drawing and ran all the way home. Because of this, Sy didn't want to try and learn anymore, he didn't want others to see him fail. Once in a while, Harlow caught him writing in a made up language instead. When asked about it, Sy refused to talk about it.</p>

<p>Other kids weren't very kind to him even with Token as a friend. His friendship wasn't enough to keep others from teasing. To make matters worse, one day, even Token began ignoring him while in school. It was as if, he had suddenly realized Sy could damage his reputation. Token still enjoyed his time with Sy though, he would continue to talk to him when class was out, when there was no one around to judge. Sy was too shy to say anything, he didn't want to lose his only friend.</p>
<p>At that point Harlow noted changes in Sy's behavior, he was aggressive and kept to himself. She hoped he didn't have the same behavioral issues as Michael did. Confronted with those thoughts, Harlow was forced to linger back in her memories of Michael and eventually remembered his book. Michael had been writing a book for the most of his life, and after his death, she had never thought of looking for it. She had put all of his stuff away, so she wouldn't have to think about him. She went to look for it, and eventually found the book. The pages were written in a language she did not understand. She was troubled by this, he had never mentioned he knew such a language. She spent a lot time looking up information about that form of writing, she found nothing. A part of her thought that maybe Michael had a few marbles loose after all. She couldn't believe he'd written an entire novel in complete nonsense.<p>
<p>One morning, plagued by memories of Michael, she walked by Sy's bedroom and saw that same type of writing on a drawing on his door. Harlow couldn't believe it. Writing like in Michael's books, hidden in plain sight. She always thought Sy had made it up for fun, like a sort of alien language. Perhaps Sy had found the book as a child and thought that he could copy his father's writing? Harlow confronted her son with it, showing him the book and forbidding him to write like this. She didn't want to admit it, but it scared her. What was the point of writing a book others couldn't read?</p>

<p>Sy had never seen the book before, but now that he'd seen it he wanted to read it. He snuck into his mother's room one night and brought it back to his room. He opened up the book and began to try and read. The gibberish Harlow thought Michael had written was in fact a real language. His eyes scanned through the pages, it wasn't nonsense, he was able to read everything. He couldn't understand the writing but the words were being read out aloud in his head. He spent the night reading through the novel, which turned out to be a travel diary. It spoke of a lot of things and places he had never heard about. The last entries were troubling, Michael had drawn the portraits of people he claimed had followed him between worlds. After that, his writing became less coherent, disjointed. His last entry was just words, scattered all over the page. Sy stared. He couldn't understand what had happened to his father. He was now determined to find that place. This... Circa.</p>

<p>THE OTHER WORLD</p>

<p>Sy began asking questions about Michael. They had a conversation about how distracted he was, and how in the end all he would do is sleep. Harlow couldn't talk with him, his mind was gone. He had a look on his face; brows furrowed, as if he was trying to figure out where he was all the time. It made him look severe, like an elderly man. The only time he seemed normal was when he was asleep, his traits softened and sometimes he would smile. Every day Harlow wished he would wake up to her with that same smile, but as soon as he opened his eyes his quirks returned.</p>

<p>That night, Sy went to sleep and a creature came to him. The creature was black with a white face. "Hello" it said. "You want to come with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes".</p>

<p>The creature smiled, a pale hand slipped out of the void and touched his arm before gently taking his hand. Sy's skin began to feel tight, as if he was being pulled forward rapidly. He could see a tiny point in the distance, getting bigger and bigger. Then Sy noticed something at the corner of his eye, a shape rushing towards them. "It's okay." The creature reassured him. "We are almost there."</p>
<p>The tiny point in the distance grew bigger until it enveloped them completely, leaving a tiny speck of black behind, which disappeared with the shape following them and the void. He looked at where he was, a new place. He stood in the other world his father had written about. A beautiful place, covered in green hills with a flawless blue sky. This place was perfect. Now he understood why his father was coming over here so much. "Is Michael here?" he asked the creature.</p>

<p>"There is no simple answer to this question."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"A creature of greed."</p>

<p>Sy didn't understand, "What?"</p>

<p>"A selfish desire, that had long festered, pushed another of this world to take Michael for their own."</p>

<p>"So he's alive?"</p>

<p>"This question has no meaning in a place such as this."<p>

<p>Sy knew then that Michael was here, in some form anyway. He was happy about that, but it troubled him to know that someone had taken him. He wasn't even sure what that meant, why would anyone want to take his father? "He was a friend of yours then?"</p>

<p>"We had many pleasant discussions."</p>

<p>Sy had so many questions. "You don't know who could have taken him, the ones who were following him? He wrote about them in a book."</p>

<p>"Michael knew many. No enemies. No way to know who."</p>

<p>"I will find him," he told the creature. "What do i call you anyway?" he finally asked.</p>

<p>"I have many names."</p>

<p>"Pick one."</p>

<p>"One? One name could hardly emcompass the whole that I am.<p>

<p>"Oh, well. Say I need to shout to you, what do i call you?"</p>

<p>"You will never need to shout for my attention."<p>

<p>Sy groaned, "Never mind that then." In his mind, in secret, Sy decided to call this creature Azi but never did tell it that.</p>

<p>After that encounter, Sy and Azi spent a great deal of time exploring the other world, or Circa as his father called it. After what felt like ages, Sy felt his skin tightening again but this time he was being pulled backward.</p>
<p>"How do i get back?!!" he screamed as Azi got farther and farther away from him.</p>
<p>"I will come," Azi answered.</p>
<p>The world fell away, and became a coloured speck. No one followed this time, perhaps his mind had fabricated it the first time. He fell back into the void, and then... Sy opened his eyes, he was in his bed at home. He remembered everything. He felt rested and yet he felt like he had traveled so far away. He looked at the hour, it felt like he had been wandering for weeks but time here had not passed so quickly. Sy was excited, a new place that no one else knew about... a place to call his own that he could escape to.</p>
